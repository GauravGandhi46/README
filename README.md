# Explanation of XOR Encryption/Decryption Code

## Overview

The code provided attempts to decrypt a given ciphertext using a simple XOR encryption algorithm. XOR (exclusive OR) is a bitwise operation that can be used for simple encryption and decryption. In this algorithm, a key is XORed with the plaintext to produce the ciphertext, and XORing the same key with the ciphertext recovers the original plaintext.
